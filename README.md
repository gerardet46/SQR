# Simple QR (SQR)
![Download SQR.apk](https://github.com/gerardet46/SQR/releases/download/1.0.0/SQR.apk) (see Releases)

All QR readers in Play Store have ads and many buttons which we never use. This reader has *no ads* and the flash button is the only one in the app. Simple. Just scan your code and obtain the result, no history and it doesn't store **any** kind of data.

For this reason, this app is extremely fast and lightweight (zxing library and android layouts make the 70% of the app size). The only porpouse of this app is for me to have a qr reader that sucks less, following the Unix philosophy, and in catalan. As I only use it for the restaurants and I only need to scan the code once and go to the website provided.

## Requirements
- Android SDK >= 23 (works on ~90% devices)
- Camera permissions

## Features
- Scan QR codes (text, websites, sms, phone numbers, contact, wifi, ...)
- Simplicity to parse results (shows a message with the result with a "*Cancel*" and "*Open*" button, depending in the type of QR)
- Available in 3 languages: Catalan, Spanish, English
- Flash button (top-right)
- Auto focus to make easier to read from camera

## What it doesn't have (actually more features)
- Ads
- Google Play services or other non-privacy stuff
- Other type of codebars (only QR)
- Unneeded options such us history, help, sponsor messages, ...

## Installation
Just go to releases and donwload the `apk` file in your android phone. You may need to allow your cell to install apps that are from unknown developers. Don't worry, this app doesn't contain spyware or virus (you can check the source code)
